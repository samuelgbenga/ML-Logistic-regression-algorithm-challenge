I made use of Google colab notebook quit similar to jupiter note book.
The name of my solution is Assignment1.ipynp and it appears twice directly on the DNS repo and indirectly on the folder i created.
This happened because i couldnt possibly find my through to copying the solution into the folder i created so i tried a direct upload on the repo and it worked.
