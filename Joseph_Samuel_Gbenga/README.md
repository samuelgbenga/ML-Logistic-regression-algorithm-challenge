I made use of Google colab notebook quit similar to jupiter note book.
The name of my solution is Assignment1.ipynp and it appears twice directly on the DNS repo and indirectly on the folder i created.
This happened because i couldnt possibly find my through to copying the solution into the folder i created so i tried a direct upload on the repo and it worked.

i made use of data from kaggle Through this link https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-data-sets/1846/3197/bundle/archive.zip?
it contains 400 observations.
About my code
i used Age as my predictor class and purchase as my target class.
To the code.
i made use of two methods
1) The gradient descent Algorithm which implents the loss function.
2) The gradient ascent algorithm which implements maximum likelihood estimation function.
Although the method i used is fixed. it works with only one predictor one nominal target class.
since i made use of only b0 and b1 as my regression co-efficence or weigh.
Deploying the two method on a scale of 0 to 1, the accuracy of both method hits 0.725
